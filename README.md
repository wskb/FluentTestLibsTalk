Fluent Test Assertion Libraries
===============================

Overview

This repository contains material used during a presentation delivered at 
[EJUG](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ejug) on April 20, 2015.

A developer sits at his desk, writing tests. He types:

	String prediction = prognosticator.getPrediction();
	assertTrue("Expected the prediction to contain \"early spring\", but was: \"" + prediction + "\"", prediction.contains("early spring"));

The developer throws up his hands, falls dramatically from his chair to the floor, and 
wails, "Why must I type so much and create lines so long to get meaningful assertion 
failure messages?"

Do you suffer from having to type too much when creating test assertions? Do long and 
repetitive test assertions confuse you and cause your editor to grow unsightly horizontal 
scroll bars? You need to learn about fluent test assertion libraries! At an EJUG talk!
Donâ€™t miss discovering the latest stars: 
[AssertJ](http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/) and 
[Truth](https://github.com/google/truth); with a special appearance by 
[Hamcrest](http://hamcrest.org/).
All this for just one easy payment of a lunch hour!
